# SimilarityChecker
This is a project made to compare different implementations of the map ADT. Now, two implemenations are avalible: **Binary Search Tree** and **AVL tree**.

### How to use
Once built, you have to move a folder with text files to the CWD of the program. To run the program you must use three different flags:
- **-d**, specifies the directory where you placed the text-files
- **-m**, specifies what map implementation to use:
  - BST
  - AVL
- **-n**, specifies the size of the n-grams to compare.
