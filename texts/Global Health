The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a new report highlighting the growing concern over non-communicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. These diseases, which include heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, are now responsible for more than 70% of global deaths. The report stresses the need for governments to implement stronger health policies that focus on prevention, such as encouraging healthier lifestyles, improving access to medical care, and promoting public health campaigns. As the global population ages, addressing the rise of NCDs has become an urgent priority for public health systems around the world.
