The internet began as a military project in the late 1960s known as ARPANET, developed by the United States Department of Defense. Initially designed to facilitate communication between research institutions, the network quickly expanded to include universities, government agencies, and private entities. By the early 1990s, the development of the World Wide Web allowed the internet to become accessible to the public. Today, the internet is an integral part of modern society, used for everything from communication to commerce and entertainment.
