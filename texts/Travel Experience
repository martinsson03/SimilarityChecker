Last summer, I went on a road trip with some friends to the Grand Canyon. We took a route that passed through several national parks, including Zion and Bryce Canyon, which were absolutely stunning. The red rock formations and towering cliffs were unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Once we finally got to the Grand Canyon, we hiked to the rim and watched the sunset. The colors of the sky and canyon were so vibrant, it almost felt like a dream. It was one of the most unforgettable trips I’ve ever taken, and I can’t wait to do it again.
