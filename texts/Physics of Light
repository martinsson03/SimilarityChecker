Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. It travels through space at a constant speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second in a vacuum. The behavior of light can be described by wave equations, with different wavelengths corresponding to different colors in the visible spectrum. However, light can also be modeled as particles called photons, which have no rest mass but carry energy proportional to their frequency. This duality of wave and particle behavior is central to quantum mechanics and plays a significant role in various technologies, such as lasers and fiber-optic communication
