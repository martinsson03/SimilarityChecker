Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on building algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The process typically involves training a model on a large dataset, where the model adjusts its parameters based on the patterns it detects in the data. Common types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type has its own set of techniques and applications, ranging from classification tasks to complex game-playing strategies.
